# Variable declarations
# these result in declaration of 3 ClientRealSimVarIFace objects to the solver and setting 3 initial values
#
variables:

	y;
	m;
	x;

#
# Equation declarations.  Each of these results in an equation object which binds the declared variables above
#
# In this case we are declaring an equation named "f" with the formula "mx"
#
equations:

	line:=y-m*x;
	der(line,y,1):=0;
